"""Semantic intensity inference from the patient's own words.

Why this exists
---------------
The language model is asked to fill ``intensity`` only when the patient used a clear qualifier.
Small local models mostly return ``null`` unless the patient literally says "mild", "moderate" or
"severe", and the assessment then stopped to ask the therapist for something the patient had
already said ("I get really irritated ... if I get very upset I go to my room and stop talking to
anyone").

This module reads the patient's response the way a clinician would. It looks for:

* degree modifiers        ("a little", "quite", "really", "very", "extremely", "unbearable" ...)
* a stated number         ("7 out of 10")
* frequency               ("every day", "all the time" ... / "sometimes", "once in a while")
* duration                ("for hours", "for months" ...)
* behavioural / functional impact (withdrawing, not sleeping, arguing, crying, can't work ...)

and combines them into Mild / Moderate / Severe. It is deliberately conservative:

* It NEVER invents severity. With no usable cue it returns ``None`` and the caller asks the
  therapist (that is the only case where the "intensity not mentioned" question is shown).
* A single weak cue (for example only "sometimes") is not enough.
* Nothing here is tied to a particular patient sentence; the cue lists are the general vocabulary.

The function is pure (no I/O, no model call), so it is cheap to run on every answer and easy to
test. Word lists live in this file on purpose: they are clinical-language cues that a domain
reviewer may want to extend, and they are listed in the "requires validation" notes.
